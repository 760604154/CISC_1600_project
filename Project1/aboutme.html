  <div class = "box-left">
    <p><span class="firstletter">Z</span>ejun and Haolin are both computer science major.
      We share many interests, both of us like to play games, like to write code
      and very passionate about learning computer languages. We also attending many
      of the class together this semester too. For ex: statistic class, multimedia
      class, and etc. We love to cooperate with each other if we have difficulties
      in class, and we will figure it out together. Long live to our friendship!
    </p>

  <div class="box-left">
    <p><span class="firstletter">A</span>lthough both of us are very eager to learn
      how to write different computer language code, but we are also willing to work on
      whatever computer science internship that could help us in our future carrer. It is
      never enough to just study in school without communicating with others. It will always
      be good to have some social experiences working with others, and in the meantime earning
      some extra money from the internship. So, if there are any internship opportunities that
      are available, please let us know and we will try our best. </p>
