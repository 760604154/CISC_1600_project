      <p><span class="firstletter">Z</span>ejun and Haolin are both computer science major.
        We share many interests, both of us like to play games, like to write code
        and very passionate about learning computer languages. We also attending many
        of the class together this semester too. For ex: statistic class, multimedia
        class, and etc. We love to cooperate with each other if we have difficulties
        in class, and we will figure it out together. Long live to our friendship!

      <p><span class="firstletter">A</span>lthough both of us are very eager to learn
        how to write different computer language code, but we are also willing to work on
        whatever computer science internship that could help us in our future carrer. It is
        never enough to just study in school without communicating with others. It will always
        be good to have some social experiences working with others, and in the meantime earning
        some extra money from the internship. So, if there are any internship opportunities that
        are available, please let us know and we will try our best. </p>
